# **What I learned creating this project**

I learned using different hooks such as useState, useEffect, useReducer, and useRef.
I also learned about Conditional Rendering which is helpful in showing different components
based on conditions. The main topic that I implement here is the **'useReducer'** hook. Since this
application is a little bit complex because of connection of different components, the **'useReducer'**
hook helps to manage and maintain different data that constantly changes based on the component rendered in
the screen.

# How to use this project

1.) Click the 'New' button and provide the information needed to the modal that pops out.

2.) You can see that there are three buttons
